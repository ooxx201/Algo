# Decode String

LeetCode 394: https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/

## Thinking Process

We can devide the str into different pieces, one pices can be a character or a enacoded string.
I just need to decode all enacoded string and concatenate all pieces, then I can get the decode string.
For each pieces, do the same process.
 

## Solutions

### BFS with Per-level Queue

we can enqueue all nodes of the same level into the same queue but use different queues for different levels. 
We enqueue the root into the level 1 queue. When we dequeue the root we will enqueue its child nodes into level 2 queue. 
When we dequeue nodes from level 2 queue, we will enqueue their child nodes into level 3 queue. 
We can optimize this technique and only keep track of two queues — 
one for the current level we are dequeueing through and one for the next level that we are enqueuing into.

## Code

### BFS with Per-level Queue

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
const levelOrder = function(root) {
    if (!root) {
        return [];
    }
    
    let thisLevel = [root];
    let nextLevel = [];
    const result = [[root.val]];
    while (thisLevel.length > 0) {
        const node = thisLevel.shift(); // dequeue
        if (node.left) {
            nextLevel.push(node.left);
        }
        if (node.right) {
            nextLevel.push(node.right);
        }
        if (thisLevel.length === 0) {
            if (nextLevel.length !== 0) {
                thisLevel = nextLevel;
                nextLevel = [];
                result.push(thisLevel.map(node => node.val));
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
};
```

## My Weakness /Bugs

1. [Weakness-1] Can’t figure out how to store level information in BFS.

This problem is intuitive with DFS. However, some people will start with BFS. Sometimes the interviewer might ask for a BFS solution. Then some people are stuck at not being able to figure out how to identify the level of a node because it’s hard to pass that information around in BFS.

2. [Weakness-2] Can’t figure out...

3. [Bug-1] Forget to push node into queue while expanding the nodes

4. [Bug-2] Mistake when ...
