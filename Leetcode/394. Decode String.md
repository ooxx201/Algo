# Decode String

LeetCode 394: https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/

## Thinking Process

We can consider a encoded string as a tree. Each subtree can be a character or a encoded string.
 

## Solutions

### DFS through Stack 

We can do DFS, decode the strings that do not contains any sub encoded string. Then do it repreatly.
After several times, the whole string will be decoded.

## Code

### DFS through Stack

```Python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        st = [[1, '']]
        res = ''
        v = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            c = s[i]
            if c.isdigit():
                v = v * 10 + int(c)
            elif c == '[':
                st.append([v, ''])
                v = 0
            elif c == ']':
                n, ss = st.pop()
                print(st)
                st[-1][1] += n * ss
            else:
                st[-1][1] += c
        
        return st[0][1]
                
```

## My Weakness /Bugs

1. [Weakness-1] Can’t figure out how to store level information in BFS.

This problem is intuitive with DFS. However, some people will start with BFS. Sometimes the interviewer might ask for a BFS solution. Then some people are stuck at not being able to figure out how to identify the level of a node because it’s hard to pass that information around in BFS.

2. [Weakness-2] Can’t figure out...

3. [Bug-1] Forget to push node into queue while expanding the nodes

4. [Bug-2] Mistake when ...
