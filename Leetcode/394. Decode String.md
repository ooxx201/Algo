# Decode String

LeetCode 394: https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/

## Thinking Process

We can consider a encoded string as a tree. Each subtree can be a character or a encoded string.
 

## Solutions

### DFS through Stack 

We can do DFS, decode the strings that do not contains any sub encoded string. Then do it repreatly.
After several times, the whole string will be decoded.

## Code

### DFS through Stack

```Python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        st = [[1, []]]
        res = ''
        v = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            c = s[i]
            if c.isdigit():
                v = v * 10 + int(c)
            elif c == '[':
                st.append([v, []])
                v = 0
            elif c == ']':
                n, ss = st.pop()
                st[-1][1] += n * ss
            else:
                st[-1][1].append(c)
        
        return ''.join(st[0][1])
```

## My Weakness /Bugs

1. [Weakness-1] Use string concatenation to add new characters to buff, this will cost O(n) time.
